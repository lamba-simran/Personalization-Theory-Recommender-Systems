# Part I
Explored various collaborative filtering algorithms such as SVD, SVD++, NMF and KNN, and developed evaluation methods to check scalablity, accraucy, coverage in cross-validation setup.

# Part II
Built a recommender system by implementing Locality Sensitive Hashing using Minhash. In addition, we explored the ALS collaborative filtering algorithm in PySpark.
